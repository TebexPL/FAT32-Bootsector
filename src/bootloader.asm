;Welcome!
;Before you look at code below I only want to explain something:
;Most of the code could be written more efficiently, but
;as the name indicates(bootsector) I only had 446 bytes
;to write all of this, so thing that mattered the most was space
;Let's now jmp into the code:

;As I said space matters so I overwrited executed code with DAP data
;DAP is a piece of info about sectors on disk you want to read or write,
;which you later 'show to the BIOS' by an interrupt
%define size 0x00       ;byte: size of a DAP(always value=0x10)
%define nul 0x01        ;byte: NULL-which means value=0x00
%define sectors 0x02    ;word containing number of sectors to be written/read
                        ;REMEMBER that multi byte fields must be in Little-endian
%define offset 0x04     ;word containing offset address to buffer in memory
%define segment 0x06    ;word containing segment address of buffer in memory
                        ;REMEMBER segment address is multiplied by 0x10, so:
                        ;offset 0x7C00 is equal to segment 0x07C0
%define address 0x08    ;Quad word containing LBA address to sector you want
%define dev 0x10        ;byte containing number of device we're booting from
%define fat 0x11        ;double word containing LBA address to start of FAT table
%define data 0x15       ;Quad word containing LBA address to start of Data clusters

;Theese are addresses to info which will be loaded and are hardwired to this code,
;and hardwired to positions of segments and DAP offsets
%define clustersize 0x020D  ;address of 'sectors per cluster' info
%define ressecs 0x020E      ;address of 'reserverd sectors' info
%define numfats 0x0210      ;address of 'number of FATS' info
%define fatsize 0x0224      ;address of 'FAT size' info
%define curcluster 0x022C   ;address of 'current cluster' info

%define first_part 0x01BE
